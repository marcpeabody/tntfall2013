<a id="strength">Cross Train Strength</a>
If you don't already have a quality Strength training program, these are great little routines to mix and match.
30-60 of a solid effort should provide great benefits and reduce chances of injury.

<a id="aerobic">Cross Train Aerobic</a>
You will probably have some muscle soreness from the previous day's long run.
A good low-impact activity will flush out the toxins and should actually leave you feeling more refreshed.
You have a lot of options for Aerobic Cross Training. Put in 30-60 quality minutes.
<br/>
Expect to sweat a lot. Your effort level should at least match a quality run.
<br/>
Preferred Cross Training: (combine as many as you like)
<ul>
  <li>Bike</li>
  <li>Swim</li>
  <li>Row</li>
</ul>

Do not count these:
<ul>
  <li>Sports - there is often not enough consistent effort and they often involve a lot of changing directions which can twist or roll an ankle.</li>
</ul>

<br/><br/><br/>
<a id="easy">EZ Runs</a>
This should be slow enough that you can chat with a friend or be in tune with the nature that is around you.

<br/><br/><br/>

<a id="intervals"><i class="icon-time"></i> Intervals</a>
This is only for experienced <i class="icon-time"></i> runners who have not been battling any injuries.
Intervals should help you improve your VO2 max, which will make your body more efficient on race day.
You will run the distance prescribed (ie 800m), recover, and start again.
It's preferred that your recovery be an EZ jog that gives you just enough time to be ready for the next one.
I personally like around 2-2.5 minutes, or around 400m.
So, for 800m intervals, you'll run 800m fast, 400m slow, and repeat.
Make sure you get at least the day's full mileage. A day that says "8 miles with 8x800m" would require about 2 miles of warmup/cooldown in addition to the 6 miles that 8x800m (with 400m recoveries) would provide.
<br/><br/>
You should run fast enough during the interval that the first bit of your recovery distance still seems a bit taxing.
This will teach your body to regather strength while still expending some energy and will pay dividends on the final miles of your race.
You should, however, keep your pace slow enough that your first, middle, and final intervals are at the same pace.
400m ~= quarter mile
800m ~= half mile
1600m ~= one mile
(Note: if you are training for the Marathon and running 800m intervals, see <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Yasso_800s">Yasso 800s</a>)

<br/><br/><br/>

<a id="hills"><i class="icon-time"></i> Hills</a>
This is only for experienced <i class="icon-time"></i> runners who have not been battling any injuries.
Find an incline that is about a quarter mile long. The group train meets to run the Sharon Wood hill that's closest to the park entrance.
Your overall speed will be slower than doing 400m intervals but the effort/stress level should be about at a 400m interval level.
Try to leave enough in the tank to run your first, middle, and final hills at the same pace.
This workout should feel difficult but not to the point that you would dread doing them again.

<br/><br/><br/>

<a id="tempo"><i class="icon-time"></i> Tempo</a>
This is only for experienced <i class="icon-time"></i> runners who have not been battling any injuries.
There are a lot of different theories and ideas of what a Tempo run means.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="5">Gradually slow back down to EZ for the remaining minutes</td>
    </tr>

<br/><br/>

<a id="racepace"><i class="icon-time"></i> Race Pace</a>
This is only for experienced <i class="icon-time"></i> runners who have not been battling any injuries.
Some runs can be augmented with a certain number of miles being at race pace.
This is the speed you believe you'll be able to match come race day.
If only part of a run is to do be done at race pace, let it be near the end of the run.
