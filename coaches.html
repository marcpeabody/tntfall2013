In short, I've been running for as long as I can remember.
Recently, I've completed two tri's, countless 1/2's and 4 marathons.
I love volleyball and still play from time to time.
<br/><br/>
I have an undergraduate degree in exercise studies and sports management and am also a certified aerobics instructor (though I'm not currently teaching).
I work for Nationwide Insurance as a human resource professional - specifically employee relations.
I have a daughter, Kyah, who is turning 2 in just a few weeks.
My hubby, Brent, is an avid basketball fan and coaches at Worthington Killborne at the varsity level.

A little over 5 years ago I would have told you I'm not a runner because I don't have the lungs for it.
I'd usually make it about half a mile and quit, doubled over and gasping for air.
<br/><br/>
Around that time my dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable form of blood cancer.
Emotionally, I didn't know how to deal with it, so I just went outside and ran.
I made it a mile.
But it was my first time ever running a full mile and it made me realize that maybe it was something I could do.
<br/><br/>
So I kept doing it.
<br/><br/>
And now, with Team, I run to help others survive.
The Cap City Half and Wendy's Tri this year were my first events with TNT and I've completed two marathons already this year while training.
I'm grateful for the friendships I've made and the inspiring people I've met.
