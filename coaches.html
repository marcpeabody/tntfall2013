I've been running for as long as I can remember.  My favorite distances are the 10K, the &#xbd; marathon and (depending on the day you ask me) the full marathon.   I also love playing recreational volleyball.
<br/><br/>
I have a degree in exercise studies and sports management which can come in handy when training.  I'm  a certified aerobics instructor and work in Human Resources at Nationwide Insurance.  My husband and I have a spirited 2 year old who loves gymnastics and swimming - though we need to work on her running form! :)
<br/><br/>
I truly look forward to making a meaningful impact in the community and look forward to working with each of you.

A little over 5 years ago I would have told you I'm not a runner because I don't have the lungs for it.
I'd usually make it about half a mile and quit, doubled over and gasping for air.
<br/><br/>
Around that time my dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable form of blood cancer.
Emotionally, I didn't know how to deal with it, so I just went outside and ran.
I made it a mile.
But it was my first time ever running a full mile and it made me realize that maybe it was something I could do.
<br/><br/>
So I kept doing it.
<br/><br/>
And now, with Team, I run to help others survive.
The Cap City Half and Wendy's Tri this year were my first events with TNT and I've completed two marathons already this year while training.
I'm grateful for the friendships I've made and the inspiring people I've met.

When I graduated from college, I had a problem.  For the first time in my memory I didn't have a coach telling me where and when to exercise.  I had always thought I was an athlete, but without that organization I quickly lost all my fitness and gained 40 pounds.  Then, in winter of 2011, my girlfriend told me her company would be putting a team together for the 2012 New York City Triathlon, through Team in Training.  I waffled for a while, using work as an excuse.  I was a landscaper and I feared I wouldn't have the energy to do both  In reality, however, I was worried I couldn't do it.  I had never run farther than a 10K.
<br/><br/>
I did do it, however, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  I got into great shape, made some of my closest friends in New York and most of all found out how exhilarating it was to do something for a cause outside myself.  Since that first triathlon last July, I've run two marathons and one half-marathon, as well as one other tri and several smaller road and bike races.  My girlfriend said I'd get hooked, and she was right.  This summer, while training with you, I'll be working toward running a half-ironman at Rev3 Cedar Point, as well as a 25K trail race and a fall marathon.  I truly love long distance races.
<br/><br/>
I can't wait to see where this season takes us.  If my past experience is any indication, I'll make some great friends and have one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
<br/><br/>
It's going to be a good summer.
